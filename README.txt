patch dsx.asm to your ROM if you have not already done that with other sprites.

put these files in your sprites directory in sprite tool:
floatingrock.bin
floatingrock.cfg
floatingrock.asm

insert the palette into your level
The only custom part of it is some extra colors in palette D

Feel free to report any glitches to me, SMWEdit, at SMWCentral (or wherever)
